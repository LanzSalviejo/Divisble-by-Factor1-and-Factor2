Criteria of the program:

Write a program that displays the integer numbers from MIN_NUM to MAX_NUM that are divisible by
FACTOR1 and FACTOR2:
      • Implement the program two ways: 1) with a do-while loop and 2) with a for loop
      • For the output, ensure the numbers output are separated by exactly one space and no more than
      NUM_PER_LINE numbers per line of output
      • Use the following named constants to implement this program (they align with the named constants used
      above):
      
                  // Constants
                  
                  final int MIN_NUM = 100;
                  
                  final int MAX_NUM = 999;
                  
                  final int NUM_PER_LINE = 6; //Numbers printed per line
                  
                  final int FACTOR1 = 3;
                  
                  final int FACTOR2 = 7;
